Image caption generation is a challenging task, the main idea is to automatically generate an image description in a natural language, for this project the language is English. An image caption can be a short description of the objects on the image or a more complex interpretation of the objects and their relationships. For instance, on the following figure we can see an example of image caption![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42429772/227754571-68ce88d0-b232-40f0-987a-a0e430762459.png)
